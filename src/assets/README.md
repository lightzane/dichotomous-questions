# Writing Your Dichotomous Question

We will write our data in a `JSON` file format.

## Visual Studio Code (Recommended)

To write your own dichotomous question, the easiet way is to have [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed.

Visual Studio Code will guide you on constructing the data since we have provided a `schema` that can be used as a reference.

Though you can still write just in notepad but it will be harder to memorize all the required properties.

## Create your JSON file

**your-sample.json**

Write the following in your json file

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://lightzane.github.io/dichotomous-questions/assets/schema.json"
  // Press Ctrl + SPACE here and available options will show
}
```
